# dahua-ivs-watcher
Python Dahua IVS event watcher

Built on https://i.botox.bz/watch.py that was extended by @johnnyletrois to send MQTT messages: 
https://github.com/johnnyletrois/dahua-watch.

This version was built to instead trigger Synology Surveillance Station to start a External Event
recording when a configured IVS event is received.

It's a pretty bad hack and I have only tried it with a single camera. Please pull, clone and extend.
I would love to hear about extensions and updates!
